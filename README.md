This is a JavaScript implementation of Rock Paper Scissors that takes in a user input, compares it to a randomly selected opponent input, and responds with the result of the interaction. This continues for 5 rounds, and then the final score is displayed along with whether or not the player wins. If the player or opponent reaches 3 points before the 5 rounds are completed, the game ends and declares them the winner.
